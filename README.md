<h1> Using timelines to effect rotation </h1>
<p>
Added the night-day time cycle using two directional lights, and timelines to affect the light's rotation.

Added the control system to the sun, the user can now control the timeline by pausing, playing or reversing the animation liinked to the sun rotation.

These are set up as follows:
